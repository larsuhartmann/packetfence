Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to build a VLAN isolation setup you need :

* a supported switch (please consult the list of supported switch vendors and types in the _Network Devices Configuration Guide_ including information on uplinks
* a regular, registration and isolation VLAN (VLAN numbers and subnets)
* a switch port for the PacketFence (PacketFence) server which needs to be configured as a dot1q trunk (several VLANs on the port) with VLAN 1 as the native (untagged) VLAN.

Throughout this configuration example we use the following assumptions for our network infrastructure:

* VLAN 1 is the management VLAN
* VLAN 2 is the registration VLAN (unregistered devices will be put in this VLAN)
* VLAN 3 is the isolation VLAN (isolated devices will be put in this VLAN)
* VLAN 10 is the "regular" VLAN

Please refer to the following table for IP and Subnet information :

[options="header",cols="1,2,2,2,3",grid="rows"]
|==============================================================================
|VLAN ID  |VLAN Name     |Subnet           |Gateway        |PacketFence Address
|1        |Management    |DHCP             |               |DHCP
|2        |Registration  |192.168.2.0/24   |192.168.2.10   |192.168.2.10
|3        |Isolation     |192.168.3.0/24   |192.168.3.10   |192.168.3.10
|10       |Normal        |192.168.1.0/24   |192.168.1.1    |
|==============================================================================

Note that PacketFence will these services on its registration and isolation VLANs:

* PacketFence provides its own DHCP services. It will take care of IP address distribution in VLANs 2 and 3. PacketFence will not provide DHCP services on VLAN 10 - this is the responsibility of your own infrastructure.
* PacketFence provides its own DNS service. It will take care of naming resolution in VLANs 2 and 3. PacketFence will not provide DNS services on VLAN 10 - this is the responsibility of your own infrastructure.


Adding the Registration and Isolation Interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First of all, make sure the management interface of PacketFence is connected to a 'trunk' port. We will create two interface VLAN for registration and isolation using the management interface.

The required interface types for VLAN enforcement are:

    Management
    Registration
    Isolation

Note that you can only set *one* (1) management interface.

In our example, we will create two new VLANs on the wired interface (will be ens160 most of the time).
To do so, click the 'Add VLAN' button besides the wired interface for each of the needed VLAN:

Here's a sample configuration for both of them:

Registration

    Virtual LAN ID: 2
    IP Address: 192.168.2.1
    Netmask: 255.255.255.0

Isolation

    Virtual LAN ID: 3
    IP Address: 192.168.3.1
    Netmask: 255.255.255.0

NOTE: Ignore the High-Availability options for now. If you are interested in a PacketFence cluster, please refer to the clustering section of this document. Don't forget to also edit the physical interface with the correct management network information by clicking on the network interface name (ens160).

According to our example, we'll associate the correct type the each interfaces.

    ens160: Management
    ens160 VLAN 2: Registration
    ens160 VLAN 3: Isolation

Make sure that those three (3) interfaces are in an Enabled state for the persistence to occur. We also need to set the Default Gateway which will generally be the gateway of the management network.

Finally, from *Status->Services*, restart the `haproxy` `httpd.portal`, `dhcpd`, `iptables`, `pfdhcplistener`, `pfdns` services.


Network Devices
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Please refer to the https://packetfence.org/documentation/[Network Devices Configuration Guide] in order to properly configure your devices.

Now that you have a fully functional PacketFence installation, we will provide a example of Cisco Catalyst 2960 integrated with PacketFence using mac-authentication.

To do so, login to the PacketFence web administration interface if it is not already done. Click on the Configuration tab and select the Switches under Network section.

To add a new switch (the Catalyst 2960) to the PacketFence database, click on the Add switch at the bottom.

The Adding new switch window will appear, in which, you'll enter the correct information for the integration. Use theses values to populate each of the fields; leave the others as is:

Definition:

   IP: This will be the IP of the Catalyst 2960 switch on the management network
   Description: Cisco Catalyst 2960
   Type: Cisco::Catalyst_2960
   Mode: Production
   Deauthentication: RADIUS
   Dynamic Uplinks: Checked
    
Roles:

   Role by VLAN ID: checked
   registration VLAN: 2
   isolation VLAN: 3
   default: 10

RADIUS:

   Secret Passphrase: useStrongerSecret

Snmp:

    SNMP Version: 2c
    SNMP Read Community: ciscoRead
    SNMP Write Community: ciscoWrite
   
Click Save to add the switch

The newly added switch should shows up in the list.

Configure the Cisco Catalyst 2960
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This step will discuss about the configuration of your Cisco 2960 switch in order to use it with our configured PacketFence environment.  We will assume you do everything using the switch CLI.

Enable 802.1X
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
As a first configuration step, you need to enable 802.1X globally on the switch.  To do so, use the following:

   dot1x system-auth-control

Configure AAA
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The next step is to configure AAA so it will use your newly created PacketFence server.  Make sure you replace the PF_MANAGEMENT_IP variable with your actual PacketFence management IP in the following commands:

   aaa new-model
   aaa group server radius packetfence
    server PF_MANAGEMENT_IP auth-port 1812 acct-port 1813
   aaa authentication login default local
   aaa authentication dot1x default group packetfence
   aaa authorization network default group packetfence
   radius-server host PF_MANAGEMENT_IP auth-port 1812 acct-port 1813 timeout 2 key useStrongerSecret
   radius-server vsa send authentication

NOTE: Make sure to have a local account on the switch. 

Configure switchports for MAB
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Once AAA is ready, we can configure some or all switchports to perform Mac-Authentication Bypass (MAB) (w/o voice support):
   
   switchport mode access
   authentication host-mode single-host
   authentication order mab dot1x
   authentication priority mab dot1x
   authentication port-control auto
   authentication periodic
   authentication timer restart 10800
   authentication timer reauthenticate 10800
   mab
   no snmp trap link-status
   dot1x pae authenticator
   dot1x timeout quiet-period 2
   dot1x timeout tx-period 3

If you want to test some ports with a VoIP phone (ex: Voice VLAN 100), add the following lines to your interface configuration:

   switchport voice vlan 100
   authentication host-mode multi-domain

Configure SNMP
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Finally, for some operations (like VoIP), PacketFence still need to have SNMP access to the switch.  Make sure you configure the two SNMP communities like:

   snmp-server community ciscoRead ro
   snmp-server community ciscoWrite rw

NOTE: You can refer to the Cisco Catalyst documentation for more options.  The latest documentation is available here: http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/switches/lan/catalyst2960/software/release/15.0_1_se/configuration/guide/sw8021x.html

Configure the Change of Authorization (CoA)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

aaa server radius dynamic-author
 client PF_MANAGEMENT_IP server-key useStrongerSecret
port 3799

Save the config!
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
When done, don't forget to save your configs using `write mem`!

Test and Demonstrate
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Congratulations, you have everything setup and ready!  If your setup is properly configured, you should be able to :

* reach (ping) the switch from the PacketFence environment
* login the PacketFence administrative UI (https://management_IP:1443)
* connects a client device on a mac-authentication switchport using demouser/demouser credentials, and show a registration.

VLAN Access
~~~~~~~~~~~

* make sure to configure the Registration, Isolation, and Normal VLANs on the switch
* configure one switch port as a trunk port (dot1q) with access to all four VLANs. The native VLAN should be the management VLAN (1)
* connect your host's eth0 to the trunk port
* put one port of the switch in the Registration VLAN
* put another port in the Isolation VLAN
* assign a device with a static IP (configured with appropriate subnet) in the Registration VLAN
* assign a device with a static IP (configured with appropriate subnet) in the Isolation VLAN
* make sure the device in VLAN 2 can communicate with PacketFence through (and only through) eth0.2
* make sure the device in VLAN 2 can not communicate with any device in any other VLAN
* make sure the device in VLAN 3 can communicate with PacketFence through (and only through) eth0.3
* make sure the device in VLAN 3 can not communicate with any device in any other VLAN

Testing the Out-of-Band Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can now test the registration process. In order to do so:

* connect an unregistered device into the switch
* make sure PacketFence receives the radius authentication request from the switch. Look into the PacketFence log file: /usr/local/pf/logs/packetfence.log
* make sure PacketFence handle radius request and sets the switch port into the registration VLAN (VLAN 2). Look again into PacketFence log file: /usr/local/pf/logs/packetfence.log

On the computer:

* open a web browser
* try to connect to a HTTP site (Not HTTPS, eg. http://www.google.com)
* make sure that whatever site you want to connect to, you have only access to the registration page.

Register the computer using:

* user: demouser
* password: demouser

Once a computer has been registered, make sure:

* PacketFence puts the switch port into the regular VLAN (VLAN 10)
* The computer has access to the network and the internet.
