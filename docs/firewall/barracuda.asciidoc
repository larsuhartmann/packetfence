[options="compact"]

Step 2: Verification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
For our example, when the user registers on the portal it will be registered and the role staff will be assigned. The PacketFence server will send a request to the Barracuda database.

If you want to see if it's working, open an SSH access to your Barracuda and run this command following commands:

  acpfctrl auth show

You will get that:

  [root@baracudafw:~]# acpfctrl auth show
  1 entries
  172.20.20.152/0
  origin=PacketFence
  service=PacketFence
  user=Jdoe
