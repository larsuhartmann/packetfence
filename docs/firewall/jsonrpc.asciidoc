JSON-RPC interface
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The JSONRPC module shipped with PacketFence is meant as a generic firewall SSO module to be used with Linux or BSD firewalls that do not by default ship with a vendor-specific interface to do SSO with.

A compatible server must implement the methods `Start` and `Stop`, both with the identical set of parameters provided below.

[options="compact"]
* *Protocol*: JSON-RPC 2.0 over HTTPS
* *Authentification*: HTTP Basic authentication
* *Methods*: `Start` and `Stop`
* *Parameters*:
  - `user`    _(string)_: Username that registered the device
  - `mac`     _(string)_: MAC address of the device
  - `ip`      _(string)_: IP address of the device
  - `role`    _(string)_: PacketFence role assigned to the device
  - `timeout` _(int)_:    Duration until the registration expires in seconds
* *Response*: Success must be indicated by `"result": ["OK"]`. Every string other than `OK` is taken as an error message.

A simple JSON-RPC server written in Python that is compatible with this specification and creates ipsets based on the SSO information provided by PacketFence can be found at https://github.com/tribut/ipset-rpcd.
