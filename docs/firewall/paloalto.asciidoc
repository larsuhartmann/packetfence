Installation using XMLAPI

Create a SSO role
+++++++++++++++++
You will first need to create an SSO role on the web interface on the PaloAlto firewall.

Go to *Device -> Admin Roles -> Add*.

Create the role name 'SSO_Role', under the 'XML API' tab, enable everything and validate it with 'OK'.

Create the account in PAN-OS
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Now you have created the role, you will associate an user with it.

Go to *Device -> Administrator -> Add*.

[options="compact"]
* *Name*: xmluser
* *Authentication Profile*: None
* *Password*: xmluser
* *Role*: Role Based
* *Profile*: SSO_Role (Previously created)
* *Password Profile*: None

Get the XML Key
+++++++++++++++

Go on this URL: `https://@IP-of-PaloAlto/api/?type=keygen&user=xmluser&password=xmluser`.

It should display:

----
<response status="success">
<result>
<key>
LUFRPT1jeFV6SHd1QnJHaU55dnYvRlFNSkJNeTR6Uzg9TDgzNVlj0=
</key>
</result>
</response>
----

SSO Configuration in PacketFence
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Now that we have the key, we will configure the PaloAlto firewall in PacketFence.

Go to *Configuration -> Integration -> Firewall SSO -> Add Firewall -> PaloAlto*.

[options="compact"]
* *Hostname or IP Address*: IP of your firewall
* *Transport*: HTTP
* *Secret or Key*: LUFRPT1jeFV6SHd1QnJHaU55dnYvRlFNSkJNeTR6Uzg9TDgzNVlj0= (use the key previously generated)
* *Port of the service*: 443
* *Roles*: add the roles that you want to do SSO with

Verification
++++++++++++

Now we will check that PacketFence is sending information when a user registers on the portal. If the process worked, you will see the entry in the PaloAlto database.

Use SSH on the PaloAlto firewall and run this command:

----
admin@PA-VM> show user ip-user-mapping all

IP              Vsys   From    User                             IdleTimeout(s) MaxTimeout(s)
--------------- ------ ------- -------------------------------- -------------- -------------
192.168.100.10  vsys1  XMLAPI  domain\user1                     Never          Never

Installation using syslog
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

NOTE: This installation mode is not suggested unless you use the SSO for informational purposes (no enforcement). PacketFence will use easily spoofable UDP packets to communicate with the Palo Alto firewall. If you require encryption and origin validation of the SSO messages, please use the XML API.

Create a filter
+++++++++++++++

You will first need to create a filter to parse the SSO line that PacketFence will send. This can be done in 'User Identification->User Mapping'

image::docs/images/doc-paloalto-syslog-parse.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="Syslog filter for Palo Alto SSO"]

Assign the filter to a 'Monitored Server'
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Next, configure the filter to be used in a syslog receiver on the Palo Alto. In order to do so, go in 'User Identification->User Mapping' and configure a syslog sender.

SSO Configuration in PacketFence
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Next you need to configure the firewall in PacketFence.

Go to *Configuration -> Integration -> Firewall SSO -> Add Firewall -> PaloAlto*.

[options="compact"]
* *Hostname or IP Address*: IP of your firewall
* *Transport*: Syslog
* *Secret or Key*: Ignore this parameter
* *Port of the service*: Ignore this parameter
* *Roles*: add the roles that you want to do SSO with

Verification
++++++++++++

Now we will check that PacketFence is sending information when a user registers on the portal. If the process worked, you will see the entry in the PaloAlto database.

Use SSH on the PaloAlto firewall and run this command:

----
admin@PA-VM> show user ip-user-mapping all

IP              Vsys   From    User                             IdleTimeout(s) MaxTimeout(s)
--------------- ------ ------- -------------------------------- -------------- -------------
192.168.100.10  vsys1  syslog  domain\user1                     Never          Never     
----

NOTE: If the process is not working and you get the following error `Usage: Socket::inet_ntoa(ip_address_sv)`, check that the hostname of your PacketFence server can be resolved correctly on the server itself. If its not, make sure you adjust your hosts file or your DNS server.
